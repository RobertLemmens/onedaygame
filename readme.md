# one day game
a game build in 1 day in my game engine: [daedalus-engine](https://github.com/RobertLemmens/daedalus-engine)

This is build against commit 6dd6b9a of the engine, you will need that build and installed locally if you want to compile this jar

I made this to test out the functionality from a client perspective, to figure out the points i want to improve and work on next. And also as a nice change of pace.

## Instructions
You have to survive the waves as long as you can, by shooting the swarm of enemies coming at you.
Move with WASD or the arrow keys, fire with the spacebar.
